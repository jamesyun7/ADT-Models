# ADT Models

https://explorer.digitaltwins.azure.net/3dscenes/ allows you to create rich 3d environments for your users to interact with the Digital Twins which might be in ADT.
In order to start you can follow the tutorial here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio and create a 3d view of your twin with live telemetry.

However, the first problem you are going to run in is which model to use? Inorder to solve this problem i have added a few 3d models in this repoo.
## 3d Models/samples
Under the folder **3d Models** you will find a few models where each folder contains:

1. A preview image
2. .glb file - this is what you would upload
3. License
4. Blender file if you would like to change the model itself.

## DTDLs

The **DTDL** folder contains corresponding STDL files. Please note: only a few models are available.
